Since 2022, I have been actively involved in teaching, supervising, and organizing the Pharmaceutical Biology I (PB I) practical course for second-semester pharmacy and food chemistry students in collaboration with my postdoctoral colleague every year. The PB I practical course covers a wide range of essential microscopic features of plants, microbes, and humans. This course provides a strong foundation in biology, pharmacy, and pre-clinical knowledge, preparing students for more advanced studies.

Below are some interesting medicinal plants, human tissue, and their microscopic features.
