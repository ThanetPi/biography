# Welcome to my personal website


### *Get to know me in 1 minute:*

Hi, my name is Thanet Pitakbut. I completed my PhD in Chemical Biology at TU Dortmund, Germany, sponsored by DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst or German Academic Exchange Service). 


Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at Divison of Pharmaceutical Biology, FAU, Erlangen, Germany. My current project is about investigating the molecular interactions of natural products and bacteria targeting antimicrobial resistance genes. I aim to leverage computing teachonology like AI to establish a synergistic formulation for better antibacterial treatment. 


You can find me at the official website of Division of Pharmacetical Biology: [Click here](https://www.pharmbio.nat.fau.de/person/685/).
