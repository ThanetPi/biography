### *Get to know me in 1 minute:*

Hi, and thank you for visiting my website. My name is Thanet Pitakbut. I completed my PhD in Chemical Biology under the supervision of Prof. Dr. h.c. Oliver Kayser at Technical Biochemistry, TU Dortmund, Germany. My PhD was sponsored by DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst or German Academic Exchange Service). 


I am a postdoctoral researcher under Prof. Dr. Astrid Groot at the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED), University of Amsterdam (UvA), the Netherlands. I am working on the research collaboration project "Predicting and designing olfactory molecules," which is funded by The Molecular and Material Design Technology Hub (MMD TechHub). This project is a highly interdisciplinary project that involves multiple scientific fields and experts, including biology, chemistry, mathematics, and AI. 

&nbsp;

The office website for the project can be found here: [Click](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-science/valorisation/mmd-hub/navigation/mmd-project-predicting-and-designing-olfactory-molecules.html).
