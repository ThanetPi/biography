# Welcome to my personal website


### *About me in short:*

Hi, my name is Thanet Pitakbut. I completed my PhD in Chemical Biology at TU Dortmund, Germany, sponsored by DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst or German Academic Exchange Service). 


Currently, I am working at Divison of Pharmaceutical Biology, FAU, Erlangen, Germany and my current project is about investigating the molecular interactions of natural products and bacteria targeting antimicrobial resistance genes. I aim to leverage computing teachonology like AI to establish a synergistic formulation for better antibacterial treatment.
